Deep Learning Challenge

With my analysis, for some reason I could not get close to 75% and would flounder around the 53% accuracy.

The purpose of this analysis is to see what you can do with different optimization models.

unfortunately my models did not improve. 

I used Keras, and Gradient Ascent with some of my own Keras layers to be added. But none addded to my results.
